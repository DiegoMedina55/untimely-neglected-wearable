# A Simple [Battlesnake](http://play.battlesnake.com) Written in Python

This is an implementation of the [Battlesnake API](https://docs.battlesnake.com/references/api). 

It has code to:

- Avoid the edges of the map.
- Avoid collisions with other snakes on the board.
- Avoid entering spaces too small to fit.
- Seek food when other snakes are larger.
- Blindly find food when very low in health.

### Next steps

- Deal with board hazards.
- Improve tail chasing code.

### Technologies Used

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/)
* [CherryPy](https://cherrypy.org/)
